## It's Friday..

And I moved my Crypto Notes to blog.farleyknight.com. For now it's tolerable. The typesetting is much better using MathJax.

You can find them at the links below.

* Crypto Notes - http://blog.farleyknight.com/crypto-notes/
* Crypto Notes 2 - http://blog.farleyknight.com/crypto-notes-2/

I might do notes on ML & Algorithm Analysis, so look out for those.
