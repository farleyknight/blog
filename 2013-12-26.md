# Learning a new language..

[Is Ruby dying?](http://jmoses.co/2013/12/21/is-ruby-dying.html) popped up on RubyFlow. It was followed up by [this Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6959355) post which had lots of people saying Ruby is entering it's long-term maturity phase. 

As far as I'm concerned, the JVM is going to be around for a long, long time. I had some amount of fascination with Scala, but after [seeing this Clojure code](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql), I feel that it's probably a better bet.

This level of metaprogramming (converting functions into data-structures) has been missing in Ruby for a while. To see it being developed and adopted in any language aiming for mainstream (which we could debate for months with Clojure) is kind of a big deal.

So today I'm going to take a bunch of Clojure notes.

## Clojure Basics

Clojure is a Lisp-based language, so you'd expect examples like this to work:

```clojure
(str "Hello" " " "World") ; => "Hello World"
```

```clojure
(+ 1 1) ; => 2
```

```clojure
(= 1 1) ; => true
```

```clojure
(not true) ; => false
```

```clojure
(eval '(+ 1 2)) ; => 3
```

```clojure
(cons 4 [1 2 3]) ; => (4 1 2 3)
```

```clojure
(concat [1 2] '(3 4)) ; => (1 2 3 4)
```
