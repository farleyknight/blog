# Learning a new language..

[Is Ruby dying?](http://jmoses.co/2013/12/21/is-ruby-dying.html) popped up on RubyFlow. It was followed up by [this Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6959355) post which had lots of people saying Ruby is entering it's long-term maturity phase. 

## Lisp-level metaprogramming

As far as I'm concerned, the JVM is going to be around for a long, long time. I had some amount of fascination with Scala, but after [seeing this Clojure code](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql), I feel that it's probably a better bet.

```clojure
(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]
             :from [:foo]
             :where [:= :f.a "baz"]})

(sql/format sqlmap) ; => ["SELECT a, b, c FROM foo WHERE (f.a = ?)" "baz"]
```

This level of metaprogramming (converting functions into data-structures) has been missing in Ruby for a while. Furthermore, the Rails guys have been trying to perfect [Arel](https://github.com/rails/arel) for years and still have trouble with it. To see Lisp-level metaprogramming being developed and adopted in any language aiming for the JVM is kind of a big deal.

## Clojure Notes

So today I'm going to take a bunch of Clojure notes. I started writing all of this inline, but I decided to move it to it's [own directory](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/).

* [001 Basics](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/001-basics.md)
* [002 Lists and Vectors](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/002-lasts_and_vectors.md)
* [003 Functions](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blobl/master/clojure/003-functions.md)

# Github's lack of math typesetting.. :(

Going back to my previous crypto notes, I noticed how ugly the math typesetting is. Apparently [others](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/288) have [tried](http://stevencarlislewalker.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/typsetting-math-on-github/) to combine Github + MathJax to handle this.

## Using images

One [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11256862/47535) proposed a style like this:

```
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%2Bsin%28mc%5E2%29%0D%0A)
```

which would get you: 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%2Bsin%28mc%5E2%29%0D%0A)

## Rendering to HTML using `gh-pages`

So your equations would be no better off than regular expressions. Which sucks. Even just proper syntax highlighting would be better than wrapping everything in a <code> tag.

The other possibility is to simply render the pages to `gh-pages`, which works, but I honestly would prefer people read these documents directly on github. Pointing to, for example, `farleyknight.github.io` is not as interesting as `github.com/farleyknight/blog`.

I may just give in and use `gh-pages` just for math related notes, but probably not today.

# Better ML Notes

I've forgotten a good chunk of what I learned about ML from [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml). In all honesty, that is probably my biggest motivation for rebooting this blog. Having a set of notes to look back would be very helpful in the future.

## Revisit probability theory

The problem is that I've actually forgotten a fair amount of probability theory as well! So I need to review some of that.  In particular I could probably get away with redoing notes from ML docs like [this one](http://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf).
