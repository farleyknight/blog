# Learning a new language..

[Is Ruby dying?](http://jmoses.co/2013/12/21/is-ruby-dying.html) popped up on RubyFlow. It was followed up by [this Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6959355) post which had lots of people saying Ruby is entering it's long-term maturity phase. 

## Optional typing

One thing that intrigued me, in the domain of dynamic languages, was the possibility of optional static typing. I did several months of research into how to possibly support optional types in Ruby. I actually leveraged already existing research (that fizzled out). I started working on my own optional typing for Ruby, but eventually dropped it due to the amount of work to cover the entire standard library with type annotations.

### ...is easy with Lisp

Many tutorials on how to write a type inference algorithm use Lisp as their example language. This work has already begin in Clojure, under [the core.typed library](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed).

I want to justify this use case by comparing a Clojure example (dynamically typed by default) that has [strong similarity](http://adambard.com/blog/core-typed-vs-haskell/) with some Haskell code:

```haskell
divBy :: Int -> Int -> Bool
divBy x y = y `mod` x == 0

divBy3or5 :: Int -> Bool
divBy3or5 x = divBy 3 x || divBy 5 x

euler1 :: Int -> Int
euler1 n = sum $ filter divBy3or5 (take n [0..])

main :: IO()
main = putStrLn $ show $ euler1 1000
```

And the equivalent Clojure code:

```clojure
(ann div-by [AnyInteger AnyInteger -> Boolean])
(defn div-by [x y]
  (== (mod y x) 0))

(ann div-by-3-or-5 [AnyInteger -> Boolean])
(defn div-by-3-or-5 [x]
  (or (div-by 3 x) (div-by 5 x)))

(ann euler1 [AnyInteger -> AnyInteger])
(defn euler1 [n]
  (reduce + (filter div-by-3-or-5 (range n))))

(ann -main [-> nil] )
(defn -main []
  (prn (euler1 1000)))
```

I've omitted a few extra boilerplate lines from the Clojure code, but I think this provides the best similarity between Haskell and typed Clojure.

## Lisp-level metaprogramming

While this is technically doable in any language, this type of language-level extensibility seems to be a standard in Clojure. Ruby, JavaScript, Python, etc., all lack this, despite being heavily inspired by Lisp themselves.

## Clojure Notes

So today I'm going to take a bunch of Clojure notes. I started writing all of this inline, but I decided to move it to it's [own directory](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/).

* [001 Basics](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/001-basics.md)
* [002 Lists and Vectors](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/002-lasts_and_vectors.md)
* [003 Functions](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blobl/master/clojure/003-functions.md)

# Github's lack of math typesetting.. :(

Going back to my previous crypto notes, I noticed how ugly the math typesetting is. Apparently [others](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/288) have [tried](http://stevencarlislewalker.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/typsetting-math-on-github/) to combine Github + MathJax to handle this.

## Using images

One [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11256862/47535) proposed a style like this:

```
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%2Bsin%28mc%5E2%29%0D%0A)
```

which would get you: 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%2Bsin%28mc%5E2%29%0D%0A)

## Rendering to HTML using `gh-pages`

So your equations would be no better off than regular expressions. Which sucks. Even just proper syntax highlighting would be better than wrapping everything in a <code> tag.

The other possibility is to simply render the pages to `gh-pages`, which works, but I honestly would prefer people read these documents directly on github. Pointing to, for example, `farleyknight.github.io` is not as interesting as `github.com/farleyknight/blog`.

I may just give in and use `gh-pages` just for math related notes, but probably not today.

# Better ML Notes

I've forgotten a good chunk of what I learned about ML from [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml). In all honesty, that is probably my biggest motivation for rebooting this blog. Having a set of notes to look back would be very helpful in the future.

## Revisit probability theory

The problem is that I've actually forgotten a fair amount of probability theory as well! So I need to review some of that.  In particular I could probably get away with redoing notes from ML docs like [this one](http://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf).
