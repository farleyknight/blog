# Learning a new language..

[Is Ruby dying?](http://jmoses.co/2013/12/21/is-ruby-dying.html) popped up on RubyFlow. It was followed up by [this Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6959355) post which had lots of people saying Ruby is entering it's long-term maturity phase. 

As far as I'm concerned, the JVM is going to be around for a long, long time. I had some amount of fascination with Scala, but after [seeing this Clojure code](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql), I feel that it's probably a better bet.

```clojure
(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]
             :from [:foo]
             :where [:= :f.a "baz"]})

(sql/format sqlmap) ; => ["SELECT a, b, c FROM foo WHERE (f.a = ?)" "baz"]
```

This level of metaprogramming (converting functions into data-structures) has been missing in Ruby for a while. Furthermore, the Rails guys have been trying to perfect Arel for years and still have trouble with it. To see Lisp-level metaprogramming being developed and adopted in any language aiming for the JVM is kind of a big deal.

So today I'm going to take a bunch of Clojure notes.

## Clojure Basics

Clojure is a Lisp-based language, so you'll see lots of primitives that Lisp handles well have built-in language features:

Basic arithmetic.

```clojure
(+ 1 1) ; => 2
```

Equality.

```clojure
(= 1 1) ; => true
```

Logical operators.

```clojure
(not true) ; => false
```

Evaluating quoted forms.

```clojure
(eval '(+ 1 2)) ; => 3
```

Concatenating strings.

```clojure
(str "Hello" " " "World") ; => "Hello World"
```

## Clojure Lists & Vectors

You can check the class of anything in Clojure with the function `class` (which would probably be more readable as `class-of`).

```clojure
(class [1 2 3]); => clojure.lang.PersistentVector
(class '(1 2 3)); => clojure.lang.PersistentList
```

### Question: Which is more useful, vectors or lists?

As it turns out, [vectors are](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1147975/in-clojure-when-should-i-use-a-vector-over-a-list-and-the-other-way-around). Note that rhickey = Rich Hickey = creator of Clojure:

```
[12:22] <Raynes>	When would you want to use a list over a vector?
[12:22] <rhickey>	when generating code, when generating back-to-front
[12:23] <rhickey>	not too often in Clojure
```

So lists are mostly for doing heterogeneous linked-lists, such as in metaprogramming, whereas vectors are used for generating something closer to a C/C++/Java array.

### Manipulating vectors

Appending to vectors.

```clojure
(cons 4 [1 2 3]) ; => (4 1 2 3)
```

Concatenating lists.

```clojure
(concat [1 2] [3 4]) ; => (1 2 3 4)
```
