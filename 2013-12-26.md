# Learning a new language..

[Is Ruby dying?](http://jmoses.co/2013/12/21/is-ruby-dying.html) popped up on RubyFlow. It was followed up by [this Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6959355) post which had lots of people saying Ruby is entering it's long-term maturity phase. 

As far as I'm concerned, the JVM is going to be around for a long, long time. I had some amount of fascination with Scala, but after [seeing this Clojure code](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql), I feel that it's probably a better bet.

```clojure
(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]
             :from [:foo]
             :where [:= :f.a "baz"]})

(sql/format sqlmap) ; => ["SELECT a, b, c FROM foo WHERE (f.a = ?)" "baz"]
```

This level of metaprogramming (converting functions into data-structures) has been missing in Ruby for a while. Furthermore, the Rails guys have been trying to perfect [Arel](https://github.com/rails/arel) for years and still have trouble with it. To see Lisp-level metaprogramming being developed and adopted in any language aiming for the JVM is kind of a big deal.

So today I'm going to take a bunch of Clojure notes. I started writing all of this inline, but I decided to move it to it's [own directory](http://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/clojure/).
