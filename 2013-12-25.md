# Christmas day

And I'm studying crypto.

## Crypto Notes

### XOR

_Def_: The function XOR, often times denoted by `(+)`, is defined over a pair on the set `{0, 1}^n`, such that

`0 (+) 0 = 0`
`0 (+) 1 = 1`
`1 (+) 0 = 1`
`1 (+) 1 = 0`

The XOR function has a huge role to play in crypto. It's often said that the only thing cryptographers know how to do is XOR things together. However, XOR has some very nice properties that make it useful for crypto.

_Lemma_: For any `x in {0,1}^n`, we have `x (+) x = 0`.

_Proof_: If `x = 1` then `1 (+) 1 = 0` and if `x = 0` then `0 (+) 0 = 0`.


### Ciphers

_Def_: A **cipher** is a pair `(E, D)` such that `E : (K, M) -> C` and `D : (K, C) -> M`. 

* `E` is called the encryption algorithm and `D` is the decryption algorithm. 
* Both `E` and `D` must be, at worst, polynomial-time algorithms.
* `K` is the key-space, `M` is the message-space and `C` is the ciphertext-space. 
* The functions `E` and `D` must satisify: `D(k, E(k, m)) = m` for all `m in M`.

### Perfect secrecy


### OTPs

_Def_: The **one time pad cipher** is defined as `E(k,m) = k (+) m` and `D(k,c) = k (+) c`.

_Lemma_: The OTP cipher is actually a cipher.

_Proof_: `D(k, E(k, m)) = D(k, k (+) m) = k (+) k (+) m = m`


One time pads are the most theoretically secure method of encryption. However, one time pads require encryption keys that are equal or greater in length than the message. That is to say, if `m` is the message to be sent and `|m|` is the length of the message than we need a key `k` such that `|m| <= |k|`.

This is a huge disadvantage, since whatever attacker-proof channel you have for sending the key, you can just as likely use it for sending the message itself.
