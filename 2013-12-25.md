# Christmas day

And I'm studying crypto.

## Crypto Notes

### Ciphers

Def: A **cipher** is a pair `(E, D)` such that `E : (K, M) -> C` and `D : (K, C) -> M`. `E` is called the encryption algorithm and `D` is the decryption algorithm. `K` is the key-space, `M` is the message-space and `C` is the ciphertext-space.

### OTPs

One time pads are the most theoretically secure method of encryption. However, one time pads require
