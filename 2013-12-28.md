# word2vec

So last night I started playing around, for the first time ever, with Django. I managed to get a very basic interface to gensim's word2vec functionality. Here's what it looks like:

[word2vec/django.py](https://github.com/farleyknight/blog/blob/master/word2vec/django.py)

## Naive Bayes

I worked on some ML notes. You can check it out here:

[A proof of Bayes Rule and a Naive Bayes Classifier](http://blog.farleyknight.com/proof-bayes-rule-naive-bayes-classifier/)

It's still somewhat incomplete, so expect that document to change as I add more machine learning to my math blog.
